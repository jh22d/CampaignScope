# Portugal Bank Marketing Analysis

## Introduction
A term deposit is one of the most important services provided by banks as it brings benefits to both parties, with customers being able to gain interest safely while the bank has the opportunity to gain a better return than the promised interest rate. Through this group project, we strive to answer the question, **what kind of customers are most likely to subscribe to a term deposit?** To answer this question, we use the Bank Marketing Data Set. This data set is based on a telemarketing campaign done by a Portuguese bank, which hopes to identify which customers would agree to subscribe to a term deposit. It has around 45000 instances, 20 attributes, and 1 output variable (y), the agreement or disagreement to a term deposit.
